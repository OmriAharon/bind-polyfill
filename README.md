I have created this repo in order to define a bower package only. I am not the author of this code.

Taken from the fine developers at Mozilla. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility)


NB: this method is also available in the broader [polyfills](https://github.com/inexorabletash/polyfill) bower package.
